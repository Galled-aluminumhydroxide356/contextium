# News Digest

Daily AI-curated news and opinion digests delivered by email.

## Pattern: Timer + Email

A scheduled job fetches sources, an AI agent curates and summarizes, then sends a formatted email.

## Architecture

```
Timer → Fetch RSS feeds → AI curation (summarize, deduplicate) → Format HTML email → Send
```

## Configuration

### News Sources
Define RSS feeds organized by topic:
- Technology, Science, Politics, World News, etc.
- Add/remove feeds as interests change

### Opinion Sources
Define commentary sources across perspectives:
- Different viewpoints ensure balanced coverage
- AI groups by debate topic, not source

### Email Format
Uses the shared email template (see `preferences/style_guides/email_templates.md`).

## Implementation

1. Set up RSS feed list (JSON or YAML)
2. Create automation workflow: fetch → AI summarize → format → send
3. Schedule for your preferred morning time
