# Today's Agenda

Daily morning briefing combining calendar, tasks, and active projects.

## Pattern: Briefing

A scheduled job aggregates data from multiple sources into a single formatted email.

## Architecture

```
Timer → Fetch calendar events + tasks + active projects → Compute focus blocks → Format HTML email → Send
```

## Data Sources

| Source | What | Why |
|--------|------|-----|
| Calendar API | Today's events from all calendars | Know your schedule |
| Task manager | Today's tasks and overdue items | Know your priorities |
| `projects/README.md` | Active projects list | Know your commitments |
| `knowledge/growth/goals/current-focus.md` | Current strategic focus | Stay aligned |

## Features

- **Focus blocks:** Computes free time between events for deep work
- **Color coding:** Different calendar types get different colors
- **Priority sorting:** Tasks sorted by priority/due date

## Implementation

1. Set up calendar API integration (see `integrations/`)
2. Set up task manager integration
3. Create aggregation workflow in your automation platform
4. Configure email delivery for your preferred morning time
