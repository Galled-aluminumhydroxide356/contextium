# Apps

Each folder is a self-contained app — a capability with a protocol (README) and optionally automation code.

**What belongs here:** Protocols, SOPs, and automation scripts.

**What doesn't:** Data, records, entries, logs. Those live in `knowledge/`.

**Boundary test:** Delete `knowledge/{domain}/` and the app still works (no data). Delete `apps/{name}/` and you have data with no protocol.
